# 4. Write a program that accepts a character and performs the following:
# a. print whether the character is a letter or numeric digit or a special character.
# b. if the character is a letter, print whether the letter is uppercase or lowercase
# c. if the character is a numeric digit, prints its name in text
ch = input("Enter a character: ")

if ch.isalpha():
    if ch.isupper():
        print("Letter: Uppercase")
    else:
        print("Letter: Lowercase")
elif ch.isdigit():
    names = ["ZERO","ONE","TWO","THREE","FOUR","FIVE","SIX","SEVEN","EIGHT","NINE"]
    print("Digit:", names[int(ch)])
else:
    print("Special Character")
